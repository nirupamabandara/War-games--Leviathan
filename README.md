#Step2.1 Access level 2

Leviathan – Level 1

Leviathan 1 presents us with a binary in our home directory.  If we run it we see that is a utility that ask and checks for a password. Knowing this, the binary is either reading the correct password from somewhere else or has it stored within the binary. In this case, the password is stored within the binary. We need to trace the binary. Many of you might catch the small hint to the movie Hackers within the binary. When Plague states the 4 most common passwords are love, sex, secret, and god.
